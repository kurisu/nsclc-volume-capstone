Exploratory notebooks live here. Keep data paths external (under ../../data) and avoid committing data or large outputs. Prefer saving generated figures to ../../reports/.

For capstone grading, the notebooks map to rubric elements as follows:

- **01_preliminary_data_understanding.ipynb**: data understanding and **data cleaning/QC** for NSCLC-Radiomics (Lung1) (file inventory, CT/RTSTRUCT checks, metadata sanity checks).
- **02_data_exploration.ipynb**: **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and early **model analysis** of tumor volumes, morphology, and acquisition-related effects.
